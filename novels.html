    <p class="accent-text">A survival novel laced with memory, music, and mourning.</p>
    <p>After a viral outbreak tears through the East Coast, **Dexter must travel through an America drowned in loss**, systemic collapse, and white supremacist factions to find his family. But the zombies aren’t the only thing that evolve. Told like a mixtape—episodic, fractured, raw—this novel unspools trauma, trust, and transformation at the end of the world. <i>The story challenges the traditional zombie narrative</i>, focusing on human resilience over spectacle.</p>
